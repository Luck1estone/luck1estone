## What I Do

**🏛 Template Service** — Java Archetype for microservices  
Reduced time-to-first-test from 3 days → 2 hours for 30+ services. Architected CI/CD + testing stack for 7 teams.

**💳 Payment Gateway** — E2E & Integration Framework  
Increased test coverage 0% → 80%. Introduced Quality Gates. Reduced flaky tests from 20–30% → 10–15% through deterministic data & environment isolation.

**🔗 BaaS & Integrations** — WireMock-based Testing System  
Cut regression testing by 90% (2 days → 3 hours). Replaced manual checks with stable automated contracts.
